This is a library for the Matrix Orbital LCD2041 for Arduino.

I've written and tested the library for the LCD2041 V1.50 firmware.
I do not know if it will work on later displays, nor any of the other sizes 
since I don't own any other displays.

I got all my info on the display from here: http://www.matrixorbital.ca/manuals/LCDVFD_Series/LCD2041

It has been written with to work with pre 1.0 version of the Wire library, I
will get to converting it over to 1.0 hopefully before it is released.
